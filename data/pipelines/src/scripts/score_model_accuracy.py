"""Which scoring model is worth a reader's time, measured against their votes.

Every model in `analysis.scores` writes its verdict to the site as a vote under
its own `pipeline-*` uid, and the site shows a person whose best model score
reaches `QUEUE_THRESHOLD`. Nothing in that loop ever asked whether a model is
right. This does, by reading the one label the site produces: a reader opens
somebody, looks them up, and votes -5..+5 on whether they were worth it.

The join is the awkward part, because a model's vote does not survive being
answered. `Firestore.replace_scores` retracts the score of anybody who has left
the shortlist, and a human vote is exactly what takes somebody off it - so by
the time a verdict exists, the score that caused it has been deleted. The
nightly Firestore export to GCS is what makes the pairing possible at all:
every snapshot holds the scores standing that morning, and a human vote carries
`updatedAt`, so the score a reader actually saw is the one in the newest
snapshot before their vote.

That gives two populations, and they answer different questions:

*   **queue** - a score was standing when the reader voted. This is production
    behaviour, and it is selection-biased on purpose: these are the people the
    queue put in front of somebody, which is the thing being judged.
*   **blind** - no score was standing, and the models scored the person in the
    very next run. The reader cannot have been influenced by a score that did
    not exist, and the model cannot have been seeded on a vote its input export
    predated, so this is the closest thing to a controlled test the site
    produces. It exists because ingest and review run at different speeds
    rather than because anybody arranged it, and it is small.

A model is reported on both, and a claim that holds on only one of them is a
claim about the queue rather than about the model.
