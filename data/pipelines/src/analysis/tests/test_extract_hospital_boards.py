"""Selecting the people who sit on a paid hospital supervisory board.

Three flags have to hold at once and each answers a different question, which
is the whole reason none of them can be dropped:

- ``--company-category szpitale`` says *which companies* - the same rule that
  puts ``categories`` on a place node, so the run selects the people behind
  what the site already shows under that filter.
- ``--employed-role "Rada Nadzorcza"`` says *which kind of post*, because a
  hospital's kierownik and its board sit in the same company.
- ``--paid-supervision`` says *which of those seats is a job*. It has to be
  said separately: rejestr.io reports every supervisory connection as one type
  and `KRS_RELATION_ROLES` labels the whole register "Rada Nadzorcza", so the
  role string on an unpaid rada spoleczna seat is identical to the one on a
  paid rada nadzorcza seat. Only the company's legal form tells them apart.
