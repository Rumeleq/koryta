"""Fixtures for the assertions run against a completed pipeline pass.

These tests read `versioned/`, they never run a pipeline themselves -- the run
is a separate CI job whose output they inherit. Locally there is usually no
such output, so a missing file skips; CI sets KORYTA_E2E_STRICT=1 and a missing
file fails there instead.

What they check is bands, not values. Exact counts would go red on every
Wikipedia edit; a count that halves, or a column that stops being populated, is
a real regression. The bands live in baseline.json, which is written by
`KORYTA_E2E_UPDATE_BASELINE=1` from an observed run rather than guessed.
