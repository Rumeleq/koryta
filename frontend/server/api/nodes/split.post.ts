 * The mirror image of `/api/nodes/merge`, and the harder direction. A merge can
 * be justified from what is stored - two pages carrying one `rejestrIo` are one
 * person, and nothing else has to be decided. A split cannot: relations carry
 * no record of which register entry they were read off, so no query can say
 * that this post belongs to the Michał Nowak born in 1961 and that candidacy to
 * the one born in 1972. Only a person can, which is why this endpoint asks for
 * the list rather than working it out.
 *
 * Hence `mark_only`. Noticing that a page is two people takes a moment; telling
 * their forty relations apart takes an afternoon, and the two rarely happen
 * together. A marked page keeps a note of who said so and why until somebody
 * gets to it.
 *
 * Everything not listed in `edge_ids` stays put. That is deliberate: a relation
 * nobody has attributed is still evidence about the page it was found on, and
 * leaving it is recoverable in a way that moving it on a guess is not.
