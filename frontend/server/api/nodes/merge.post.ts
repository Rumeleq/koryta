 *
 * Admin rather than a review queue, and for the same reason `/api/edges/delete`
 * is: this is not a claim somebody disagrees with, it is a page that should
 * never have existed, and making an admin file a proposal against themselves
 * adds a queue entry to a verdict that was never in doubt. What it does leave
 * behind is a merge entry in the audit log naming every relation it moved,
 * which is what an undo would need.
 *
 * The survivor is resolved through its own `merged_into` first, so merging into
 * a page that was itself merged away lands on the page a reader would actually
 * reach rather than building a chain nothing follows.
