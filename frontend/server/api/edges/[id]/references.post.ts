/** Attaches or detaches the articles a relation rests on.
 *
 * Takes the ids to add and to remove rather than the whole list, and merges
 * them against what is stored. A caller sending the array it rendered would
 * overwrite whatever was added since it loaded the page, so two people citing
 * the same relation would keep losing each other's source. The merge is a set
 * union, so it is also safe to replay.
 *
 * The write goes through `createRevisionTransaction`, which means the new list
 * lands on the edge document immediately and the revision recording who changed
 * it waits for review. That is how every edge write in the app behaves - only
 * `revision_id` waits for approval, not the data - and for a citation it is the
 * behaviour we want: a source is an annotation on a claim that has already been
 * reviewed, and hiding it until a second person looks would leave the claim on
 * screen with nothing behind it. `stored` is passed so the `set` underneath
 * keeps the edge's `published` flag and its counters.
