 * connecting them is already done.
 *
 * Neither the articles nor the topic are drawn: `getNodesNoStats` builds nodes
 * for people, places and regions only. That is the point - what a reader wants
 * from a story is who is in it, not a diagram of our filing.
 *

     * - `"people"` expands every person drawn, however they got in. What a
     *   story asks for: across a dozen articles most people arrive through a
     *   relation citing one of them, and under `"mentions"` those were the ones
     *   left as bare dots.

     * People either way. A place is the hub of an unbounded number of relations
     * - a ministry has thousands - so expanding one would bury the story's own
     * people in its staff list, and the second hop out from a person is where a
     * local graph stops being local anyway.
     *
     * A story pays for this in size: one hop from everybody in it is a much
     * larger graph than the articles alone, and a crowded affair draws a
     * crowded canvas.
