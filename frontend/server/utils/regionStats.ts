 * miss, which over two days of logs was 21 full scans for a payload of four
 * fields per region. So the same rows live in one document, written whenever
 * the node stats they come from are recomputed, and the endpoint reads that.
 *
 * The counts are exactly as fresh as they were before: `stats.people` on a
 * region node is itself only written by /api/stats/computeNodes, so this
 * document goes stale at the same moment its source would have.
