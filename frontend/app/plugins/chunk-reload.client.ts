/** Reload once when a lazy chunk has gone missing under the reader.
 *
 * A deploy gives every chunk a new hash and drops the old ones. Anyone who had
 * the site open across it is holding an entry chunk that names files the server
 * will no longer serve, so the next route change - the first click after a
 * release - fails its dynamic import and the navigation dies with nothing
 * rendered. It was the only unfixed production error in Sentry on 2026-08-31
 * (KORYTA-PL-1X, on koryta.pl and autopush both), and it always names a
 * different hash, so there is nothing to fix in the chunk itself.
 *
 * A reload is the whole repair: it fetches the current index and the current
 * hashes. `vite:preloadError` is Vite's own hook for this, and Nuxt re-emits
 * failed imports through it.
 */

/** Guards against a reload loop. If the fresh load fails the same way - the
 * asset really is gone rather than stale, say a half-finished deploy - reloading
 * again would spin. sessionStorage rather than a module variable, because the
 * reload is exactly what discards module state; and per-tab rather than
 * localStorage so one bad tab does not gag the reload in every other one. */
