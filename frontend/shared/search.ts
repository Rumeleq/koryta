/** The name index `/api/search` matches against.
 *
 * Firestore has no substring search, so a node carries every prefix of its own
 * name as an array and the query is one `array-contains` against whatever was
 * typed. Prefixes of the whole name are what let "anna n" find Anna Nowak;
 * prefixes of each word are what let "nowak" find her too.
 *
 * Lives here rather than beside the trigger that writes it because the emulator
 * seed has to produce the same index. It did not: the fixture carried a
 * hand-written list of *suffixes* from some earlier scheme, so searching a full
 * name found nobody, and every e2e spec that typed one had been failing on main
 * for as long as anyone had looked. Computed in one place, the two cannot drift
 * again.
 *
 * Whitespace is flattened to single spaces first, because the register hands
 * us names with newlines and tabs in them - a company whose full style runs
 * onto a second line, one person whose name arrived behind a stray tab. Split
 * on the literal space those became one word each with the newline still
 * attached to the front, so „ODPOWIEDZIALNOŚCIĄ” was indexed as
 * „\nodpowiedzialnością” and nothing anybody could type reached it. Thirty
 * names in the database are shaped like that; they pick this up the next time
 * their node is written, the trigger recomputing whatever no longer matches.
