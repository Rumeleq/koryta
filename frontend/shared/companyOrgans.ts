/** Which organ the register itself names as supervising an institution.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `companyBodies.ts`, which answers a different
 * question and is the one anything about pay must ask. That module reads the
 * *legal form*: an SPZOZ has a rada społeczna and cannot have a rada
 * nadzorcza, so the form settles it for all 243 of them and settles it for
 * every other company too. This module reads `dzial2.organNadzoru` - what the
 * entry actually filed - which is finer, and incomplete: 719 of the 1,192
 * SPZOZ in the crawl register no supervisory organ at all, because a rada
 * społeczna is created by statute rather than by an entry. So a value here can
 * say a board is unpaid but never that one is paid, and nothing computing
 * employment reads it.
 *
 * What it is for is reporting. /eksploruj/szpitale breaks hospital board seats
 * down by party, and a reader of that page wants to know which hospitals are
 * supervised by a komisja rewizyjna, which by something else again, and which
 * filed nothing - distinctions `supervisoryBody` deliberately collapses.
 *
 * The values are normalized upstream by
 * `data/pipelines/src/scrapers/krs/organs.py` and arrive on the node as
 * `supervisoryOrgan` through `/api/ingest/company`. This is only the
 * vocabulary and the labels, the same division of labour
 * `companyCategories.ts` and `companyBodies.ts` have.
