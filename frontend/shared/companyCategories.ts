/** The sectors a company can be filed under, and what to call them.
 *
 * This is the list the category filter on /eksploruj offers and the edit form
 * puts in its dropdown. It is *only* the vocabulary: which companies belong to
 * which sector is decided by the pipelines, in
 * `data/pipelines/src/entities/company_categories.py`, and arrives on the node
 * through `/api/ingest/company`.
 *
 * The order matches `COMPANY_CATEGORIES` in the pipelines, because that is the
 * order a company's categories are stored in and the filter reads better when
 * the two agree.
 *
 * It used to be decided here, by matching PKD prefixes against the `activity`
 * codes in the ingest payload. That does not survive contact with the register:
 * KRS carries two vintages of PKD at once (the 2025 revision split passenger
 * rail out of 49.10 into 49.11 and 49.12), a code can be declared because a
 * quarry owns a siding, and the only code that reaches PKP PLK is also carried
 * by road builders - so the mapping needs a per-company override list with a
 * reason against each entry, which is pipeline work with tests against real
 * KRS numbers, not a frontend constant.
 *
 * `categories` is a node field like any other from here on: revisioned, shown
 * in the edit form, and once a person has set it, marked
 * `categoriesSource: "manual"` so the next ingest leaves it alone - the same
 * contract `isPublic` and `isPublicSource` already have.
