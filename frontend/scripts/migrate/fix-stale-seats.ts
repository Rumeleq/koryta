/**
 * Move the seats the register disagrees with to the region it names.
 *
 * 13 companies on the site are seated in the wrong place. ELZAT of Mikołów is
 * filed under Tarnów, Centrum Medyczne Żelazna of Warsaw under Olsztyn: their
 * stored seat predates the current register and is simply wrong. The company
 * ingest resolves them correctly now but deliberately will not act - a second
 * seat from a different region is a disagreement, not a second fact, so it logs
 * the conflict and leaves the stored edge alone (see `findSeatFromAnotherRegion`
 * in `server/api/ingest/company.post.ts`). This is the hand that resolves it.
 *
 * IT MOVES THE EDGE, it does not delete and recreate. The edge is the same
 * fact - this company sits somewhere - stated about the wrong region, so what
 * it needs is a correction, not a removal and a replacement. Keeping the
 * document keeps its revision history, its `published` flag and its
 * `references`, and the site never sees the company with two seats or none.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES OF EDGE, exactly as `split-seat-edges.ts` found:
 *
 *   a random id, from before ids were derived -> `update` the `source`.
 *     Nothing reads an edge's id; `findEdge` queries on (source, target, type).
 *
 *   `edge_<source>_<target>_seat` -> the document must MOVE. Leaving it at an
 *     id naming the old region is not untidiness, it is a live hazard: if that
 *     region ever legitimately becomes an owner or seat of this company,
 *     `createEdge` computes that same id, `findEdge` misses because the source
 *     no longer matches, and `createRevisionTransaction` does `batch.set` -
 *     silently overwriting the seat this script just corrected.
 *
 * THE REVISIONS ARE NOT OPTIONAL, and for the reason `split-seat-edges.ts`
 * gives about `data.type`: `applyRevision` layers a revision's data over the
 * document, so an edge moved here whose revisions still say the old region
 * reverts the next time anybody approves one. Every revision pointing at the
 * edge has its `data.source` corrected, and a moved edge has its revisions
 * repointed by `node_id` in the same batch.
 *
 * Revisions are corrected, never deleted. Deleting the last revision for an id
 * is what mints a phantom node: `functions/src/revisions.ts` reacts to an empty
 * revision list with `nodes/<node_id>.set({revisions: null}, {merge: true})`,
 * and `set` with merge creates the document - so a typeless, nameless node
 * appears under the edge's id. Repointing is an update, and it resolves to the
 * new id, which has revisions.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO:
 *   - touch a company with more than one seat. 65 arrive with a duplicate pair
 *     from before ids were derived; that is a different repair and collapsing
 *     them here would hide it.
 *   - move onto an id that is already taken. Checked first, and refused.
 *   - invent a region. A register TERYT with no node is reported and skipped -
 *     run `create-region-nodes.ts` first if there are any.
 *
 * The register's answer comes from the same payload the ingest would receive,
 * so the two cannot disagree about where a company belongs:
 *
 *   cd data/pipelines
 *   uv run koryta CompaniesPayloads --no-backup --refresh :ProcessWiki \
 *     --output stderr 2>/tmp/companies.jsonl
 *   cd ../frontend
 *   npx tsx scripts/migrate/fix-stale-seats.ts /tmp/companies.jsonl
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/migrate/fix-stale-seats.ts <file>            # dry run
 *   npx tsx scripts/migrate/fix-stale-seats.ts <file> --commit
 *   npx tsx scripts/migrate/fix-stale-seats.ts <file> --prod --commit
 *
 * Afterwards: POST /api/stats/computeNodes, so `seatNodeIds` and every
 * employee's `targetNodeIds` pick up the region that actually holds them.
